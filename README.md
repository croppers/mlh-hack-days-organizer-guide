# About Hack Days

Hack Days are 12-hour-or-less, in-person mini hackathons powered by Major League Hacking (MLH) and our amazing partners (like Google, MongoDB, and GitHub). MLH wants organizers and hackers to have time and space to hack outside of full weekend-long hackathons. Weekend-long hackathons are awesome, and we help host over 250 a year, but Hack Days are specifically designed to be lower-lift and easier for organizers to host.&#x20;

Simultaneously, Large Language Models and Generative AI have made it more possible than ever to build a cool hack in less time. We really believe this is an exciting moment to bring mini-hackathons to the community at large.&#x20;

### **How does organizing a Hack Day work?**&#x20;

Here's the high-level overview of the steps. Make sure to check out the complete guide for all the details.&#x20;

1. **Apply to host a Hack Day.** You can do this right now. It just takes a few minutes.
2. **Secure a venue.** Wherever your club or community typically meets is fine. This can be as simple as a room reservation at the library.&#x20;
3. **No Website Required.** Attendee registration is entirely through MLH's OrganizerHQ platform. Once your application is approved, start collecting registrations for the event.
4. **Receive Swag.** As your Hack Day nears, we will ship you a physical swag pack for your attendees. This will include prizes, stickers, and swag.&#x20;
5. **Order Food and Snacks.** We recommend planning ahead, but ordering once you have a confirmed count of hackers.
6. **Get Reimbursed.** We'll reimburse you up to 350 USD for food, snacks, and other event expenses. For each hacker who checks into your event, you receive 7 USD.&#x20;
   1. _We can only reimburse you for the money you spent on the event._&#x20;
   2. _If you're outside the US, the amount we reimburse changes. See Reimbursements for more info._&#x20;
