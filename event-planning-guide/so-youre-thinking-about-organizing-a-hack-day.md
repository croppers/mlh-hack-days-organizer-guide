# So You’re Thinking About Organizing a Hack Day

### Why Organize a Hack Day?

Hosting a Hack Day is a great way to

* Build community: A short, low‑commitment hackathon fosters collaboration and networking amongst members.
* Develop leadership skills: Organizing an event teaches project management, team coordination, and event planning.
* Encourage innovation: Hack Days encourage participants to experiment with new tools such as the Google Gemini API.

Access MLH support: Organizers receive swag, prizes, and reimbursements for food.

### Getting Started: High‑Level Steps

MLH makes it straightforward to host a Hack Day. Make sure to reference our [Event Planning Guide](https://mlh.gitbook.io/hack-days/~/revisions/BoPJLEhibbHxmfNR5D9K/event-planning-guide) for a more detailed breakdown of these steps! The key steps are:

1. **Apply to host** – Submit a short application through MLH’s OrganizerHQ platform. You can apply even at the idea stage; it only takes a few minutes.
2. **Secure a venue** – Reserve a classroom, library room or other space with a projector, chairs and reliable Wi‑Fi. Make sure power outlets are available so attendees can charge laptops.
3. **Collect registrations** – Once approved, use OrganizerHQ to handle registrations and check‑ins. Update your registration page with the event time and location, contact information, a short description and information about food or beverages.
4. **Plan food and logistics** – Decide what you will serve (pizza can be an affordable option). Order from vendors that partner with your school and notify them 3–7 days before the event. Bring plates, utensils and napkins, and encourage attendees to bring refillable water bottles.
5. **Receive and distribute swag** – MLH ships a swag pack with stickers, prizes and branded goodies; arrange to receive it and plan how you’ll hand it out. You’ll also need to play a 2–5 minute recorded presentation from MLH during the event and use MLH’s platform for check‑ins.
6. **Run the event** – On the day, welcome attendees, show the recorded presentation, and share your event schedule. Encourage hackers to form teams and brainstorm projects. To enter the Google Gemini prize, teams should integrate the Gemini API. Remind participants to submit their projects on Devpost.
7. **Wrap up and follow up** – At the end, announce winners and distribute prizes. Afterwards, submit your receipts for reimbursement and provide MLH with event photos, an event summary, and project submission data. Keep your receipts; U.S. events receive up to $7 USD per attendee (max $350 USD), while rates vary for other countries.

### Tips for a Great Hack Day

* **Scope the event:** Plan for a realistic number of participants, keeping in mind that reimbursements cover up to 50 checked‑in hackers. Adjust food and supplies accordingly.
* **Communicate early and often:** Send reminder emails three weeks, one week, the day before and the day of the event. Encourage participants to read the [MLH Code of Conduct](https://github.com/MLH/mlh-policies/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md) and prepare any necessary software.
* **Create an inclusive environment:** Make sure the venue is accessible, and encourage diverse hacker participation through intentional outreach.
* **Leverage mentors:** Recruit experienced students or alumni to help participants with ideas and troubleshooting. Encourage participants to explore Google’s AI tools and share what they learn.
* **Take photos:** Photos help us to continue supporting events like yours! Please avoid posting unflattering photos (e.g., messy tables or close‑up headshots).
* **Stay flexible:** It’s okay if the schedule or participant count changes. Focus on providing a supportive space for learning and collaboration.
