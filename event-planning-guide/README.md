# Event Planning Guide

If you've completed all the steps below, you are ready for your event!&#x20;

### 🏫 Reserving a Venue

* Keep in mind that your venue will require a screen or projector, wifi, and chairs. Ensure you have the necessary equipment to project your presentation from your laptop.
* We recommend having a table at your venue for check-in and swag distribution. Keep in mind you may need extra tables to distribute food as well.
* Ensure your venue has wifi that all attendees can access. Now's also a good time to make sure your space has power outlets so folks can keep their laptops charged up!

### 🍕 Select and Order Food

* You do not need to use your funding for pizza. However, it is an affordable option that will allow you to serve a large number of people.
* Explore the vendors your school partners with for additional discounts on your order.
* For mini-hackathons, we recommend that you notify your food vendor in advance of the event. You can call a vendor 3-7 days before your event to minimize any last-minute issues.
* Make sure either you or your vendor is bringing plates, utensils, and napkins if you're providing food. You may be able to grab some of these things from your university or school's dining hall.
* If you're not providing beverages at your event, we recommend encouraging folks in your pre-event email to bring a refillable water bottle.
* Keep in mind that MLH only covers reimbursements for people who attend the event. Make sure not to over-order!
  * Example: I have 60 people registered, but I expect only 50% to show up, so I need to order pizza for 30 people. I expect people to eat two slices each, and each pizza has eight slices. I need at least 60 slices (30 people x 2 slices each), so I'll order eight pizzas for 64 slices.&#x20;

### 💻 Update your Registration Page

* Make sure you are providing the following key information:&#x20;
  * event start & end time
  * event location (be specific!)
  * contact email for questions
  * event description
  * information on the food/beverages you plan to provide

### 📦 Plan to Receive MLH Swag Pack

* We will be sending you a bunch of stickers, swag, and prizes! Make sure you have a plan to receive the swag, bring it to your venue, and distribute it to attendees.

### 📧 Email Attendees Reminders & Event Information

* Make sure to send out event reminder emails to your attendees with any new event information. We recommend sending out event reminders: 3 weeks before, 1 week before, the day before, and the day of your event. You can schedule out these emails in advance to save time!
