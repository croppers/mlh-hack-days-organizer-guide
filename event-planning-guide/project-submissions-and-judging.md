# Project Submissions and Judging

### Project Submissions

Please add [league+devpost@mlh.io](mailto:league+devpost@mlh.io) to your Devpost page.

Once we have your draft or live Devpost page, we will add Prize Categories and a few submission questions to the page.

### Judging

We will send you prizes to distribute to the winners of any MLH Prize Categories.

Please distribute all prizes to the hackers (after your winning team receives them, raffle off extras, or give away a second-place award).

We're pretty flexible on the judging criteria for our prize categories. We often tell folks to select the project they think is the coolest or that they're most excited about.
