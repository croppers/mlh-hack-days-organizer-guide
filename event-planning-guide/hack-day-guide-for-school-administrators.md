# Hack Day Guide for School Administrators

### Purpose of a Hack Day

Hack Days are **short, educational “invention marathons”** designed to give students hands-on experience with technology and encourage creative problem solving. Unlike full‑scale hackathons, they run for **12 hours or less (as few as 4 hours)** and take place during one day, so there is no overnight stay or multi‑day commitment. Students from any major can participate and learn how to use tools like generative AI. Non-student professionals are also welcome to attend.

### Educational Benefits

* **Learning through teamwork:** Students work in teams to identify problems, brainstorm solutions and build prototypes.
* **Skill development:** Participants practice collaboration, project management and communication skills, as well as technical skills in coding, design and data analysis.
* **Community building:** Hack Days can strengthen ties between departments, school clubs, technology societies, or entrepreneurial programs.

### What Administrators Should Know

* **Logistics**: Organizers need a classroom or meeting space with reliable Wi‑Fi, a projector and plenty of power outlets. MLH can provide swag; the institution should ensure that the venue complies with fire codes and accessibility requirements. Most Hack Days run on a weekend day, beginning mid‑morning and ending in the evening. However, they can run on a weekday or an alternative time if it is more convenient for participants.
* **Registrations**: Organizers are required to show a short pre‑recorded presentation, collect registrations/check‑ins through MLH and facilitate project submissions.
* **Funding and reimbursements**: MLH reimburses food expenses (e.g., meals, snacks, non‑alcoholic beverages) up to a per‑attendee limit; U.S. events receive up to $7 USD per participant and up to $350 USD total, with adjusted rates for other countries. Organizers must keep itemised receipts and submit them via MLH’s finance platform.
* **Risk management**: Because Hack Days are short and typically end before late night, they pose fewer security risks than overnight events. However, administrators should confirm that any minors have proper permissions and that campus policies (e.g., visitor policies, insurance) are followed. Organizers, volunteers, mentors, and hackers must adhere to [MLH’s Code of Conduct](https://github.com/MLH/mlh-policies/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md) and should consult the institution’s guidelines on event safety.
* **Support**: Encourage faculty or staff advisors to act as points of contact during the event, helping to resolve issues and ensuring compliance with school policies. MLH staff are available via email at hackdays@mlh.io for clarification.

### How Administrators Can Help

1. **Approve and reserve space** – Work with student organizers to book an appropriate room and ensure all audiovisual equipment (projector, microphones) is functional.
2. **Ensure compliance** – Verify that the event aligns with the institution’s policies on liability, visitor access and inclusivity. Provide guidance on working with minors if applicable.
3. **Provide mentorship and connections** – Connect organizers with faculty who can serve as mentors or judges, and encourage departments to promote the event to a broad audience.
4. **Promote campus community** – Support the organizers’ efforts to reach students from all years, backgrounds, and majors throughout the campus community. Communicate to students that Hack Days are low-barrier events, team-based, and will be supported by experienced organizers to help them grow, no matter their experience level. Utilize your broad knowledge of campus activities and groups to help organizers tailor their advertisements to maximize their impact.
5. **Encourage reflection** – After the event, ask organizers to share outcomes, photos and lessons learned. This can inform future events and demonstrate the educational impact of Hack Days.

### In Summary

Hack Days are a **low‑barrier, high‑impact** way for students to engage with technology, build community and practise creative problem solving. By providing logistical support, funding and mentorship, administrators can help their students host safe, inclusive and successful events. The MLH Hack Days program offers a structured framework—complete with registration tools, swag packs, a simple reimbursement process and expert guidance—to make it easy for schools to bring Hack Days to campus.
