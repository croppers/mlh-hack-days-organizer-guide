# Snowflake

We're looking for \~5 organizers in the US to help us pilot a special new version of Hack Days with Snowflake. If you're interested in alpha testing this program with us, please start a Snowflake Hack Day application below!

{% hint style="info" %}
**Start Your Application:** [**https://organize.mlh.io/host/snowflake-hack-days**](https://organize.mlh.io/host/mongodb-hack-days)
{% endhint %}

As part of hosting a Hack Day, you'll run a Best Use of Snowflake prize category. Here's a description of the prize, which should be added to your Devpost page:

### Best Use of Snowflake

**Arduino Tiny Machine Learn Kit**

Play with industry-leading LLMs on a single account using the Snowflake APIs. Adding AI capabilities into your application can be as simple as a single CURL command to Snowflake's REST API.

Build customized applications, RAG powered chat bots, or embed AI-powered features into your app in half the time with half the hassle. Get started for free with a special, student 120-day Snowflake trial and check out this repository for an example of the Snowflake REST API in action.

### Slides

Upon event approval, you will receive a set of slides as part of the official onboarding packet. You should present these slides to participants as part of your opening ceremony.

### Judging Info

You can reference the [Snowflake Demo Project](https://mlh.link/snowflake-demo) (also linked above) to see how Snowflake packages are referenced and how the API is leveraged in a Python code repository. \

Once you've confirmed Snowflake usage, choose the highest quality project with the most fleshed out usage of Snowflake's AI capabilities.&#x20;
