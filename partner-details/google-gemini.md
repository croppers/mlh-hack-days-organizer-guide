# Google Gemini

Google supports Major League Hacking and our Hack Days program. Google has tons of awesome AI-powered tools for hackers to leverage during your event, but we specifically encourage hackers to explore Google AI Studio and the Google Gemini APIs.&#x20;

As part of hosting a Hack Day, you'll run a Best Use of Google Gemini prize category. Here's a description of the prize:&#x20;

### Best Use of Gemini API

**Google Swag**

It’s time to push the boundaries of what's possible with AI using Google Gemini. Check out the Gemini API to build AI-powered apps that make your friends say WHOA. So, what can Gemini do for your hackathon project?

* Understand language like a human and build a chatbot that gives personalized advice
* Analyze info like a supercomputer and create an app that summarizes complex research papers
* Generate creative content like code, scripts, music, and more

Think of the possibilities… what will you build with the Google Gemini API this weekend?

### Judging Info
